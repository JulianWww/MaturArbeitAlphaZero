Time Sheet:

I started the week school started - Aug 2021
 As many of these processes were spread out, the values are not completely accurate.

1) 2h search for original paper + to read it
2) 2h to find the python implementation
3) 25h 2 weeks implementation
4) 15h implementation with Tensorflow - problems with pybind
5) 10h trying to remove pybind - fail
6) 10h pytorch implementation
7) 5h increase efficency with GPU on Google cloud platform
8) 1h install cuda - took for ever
9) 10h install cuDNN - problems that I can't download from Nvidia
10) 10h compile C++ code on ubuntu - problems with window incompatibility
	1) 3h ubuntu does not accept cout's that are not terminated by std::endl - don't know why
	2) 10s removed CPU parallelization (just one thread)(still in but deactivated)
	3) 1h because the profiler broke. I rebuilt it from scratch.
	4) 1min updated the shared repositary to valid linux files
	5) 10s created backup of include/ai/playGame.cpp at ~/backups/AlphaZero/include/ai/playGame.cpp on the gcp cloud server
	
11) 2h research MCTS parallelization: "https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/multithreadedMCTS2.pdf"
	decided on root parallelization
	removed some shared_ptr's and replaced with normal pointers as they are not thread safe
12) 2h optimized the profiler with auto detection of systemconfig
13) 1h GPU monitoring with ``nvtop``
14) 2h optimizing model performance (model saved on GPU)
15) 6h bug fixing, CUDA optimization, adding debugger, fixing problem with loss of console output when ssh disconnects (created system service) and preparing for full scale tests
16) 4h of debugging and full scale testing on UNIX P4 GCP server
17) 2h socket research and sockpp build, link, test
18) 1h console client creation - no socket (next step)
19) 1h sock server creation
20) 2h unable to load model (cannot load CUDA model to non Cuda environment, coding a CUDA to CPU programm (load to cuda, transfer all tensors, save)) - failed
21) 2h fixeing issues with sock server
22) 1h optimizing parallelization and deactivating it for run_2
23) 2h model bug fixing and changing some of the MCTS
24) 4h As the algorithm does not act as expected, there are bugs which I'm just removing by going through the original AlphaZero paper by Deepmind. The worst error so far was that the NN did not get the current game board but a zero board.
     
    Notes 25-28 were coded late at night with satelite internet. So, 1 minute to open stack overflow.
25) 8h Java and C++ GUI client - fail
26) 8h Python GUI client (success-ish) (it works but not how I wanted it (Im terrible with GUI's)
27) 2h C++ file io
28) 5h bug fixes, test suite.
29) 8h bug fixes, mostly waiting for execution
30) 4h model batching
31) 10h model batching, finding and fixing errors - abandoned
32) 1h resetting to single thread version and adding model data and single prediction. (next step is multiprediction and it must be identical to single prediction)
33) 4h multiprediction and problems in model forward predictor.
34) 10h model fit testing.
35) 10h model loading, server and cleanup (jce)
36) 2h fixing bug in model (forgot activation function)
37) 5h multiple minor bug fixes with multiple machines not comunicating correctly (server crashed)


- ~100h wrote paper and generated images.
- ~30h testing and fixing minor problems and setting up servers

Total time: 330 h (probably more)
